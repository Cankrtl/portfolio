      <p>
        Hello! I'm Can, a Junior Frontend Developer who loves developing
        user-focused interfaces. With the professional experience I gained at
        Apsiyon, I develop dynamic and responsive web applications using HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a basic understanding of JavaScript and React, and I actively
        work to address any gaps I may have in these areas. I am a developer who
        is open to learning, attentive to detail, and eager to collaborate. My
        goal is to contribute to the user experience by creating simple,
        high-performance, and scalable solutions.
